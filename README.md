PropertyPulse: A Real Estate Management Platform 


we introduce PropertyPulse, an interactive analytics solution designed to meet local real estate 
industry customer needs and assist agents from diverse 
backgrounds. As a result, PropertyPulse enhances the existing 
marketplace to help consumers discover hidden patterns, 
connect different areas for value, and search, filter, and compare 
properties for convenience. Specifically, we contribute the 
following: 
(1) To assist buyers in analyzing real estate data, we 
offer an abstraction for designing visualizations. In particular, 
our data abstraction creates a geographically-centered 
integrative real estate dataset by integrating diverse data from 
several channels. 
(2) We provide an interactive visual analytical 
method to help users not as educated about the local real estate 
market gradually become educated. Users may then utilize this 
provided knowledge to express their specific requirements when 
seeking for a property. 
(3) To visualize homes and suburbs in 
various dimensions and granularities, we offer a range of layouts. 
To create a truly multifaceted data repository, we have gathered, 
combined, and cleansed the real estate sold records over the 
previous two years in Delhi-NCR, together with their locationrelated education and facilities.
